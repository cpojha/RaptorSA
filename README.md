**RaptorSA** is a multi function bot, you can listen music, manage roles, get various informations and many other things. This Discord bot can be helpful for anyone who wants to learn how to make a discord.js bot, every command has it's own folder so it's more easy to read the entire project. I made this so new users can also look at the methods used for certain commands and get some ideas for their Discord bot.

## Common Issues & Resolutions

Please see the [Common Issues](https://github.com/Cramenorn/RaptorSA/wiki/Common-Issues) page before posting an issue.

# Api keys and tokens

Some commands require an **Api Key** or a **Token** which can be find on these websites: 

* [Google Custom Search Api Key and CX](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/)
* [Riot Games Developer](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
* [Discord Developer to get the token for the bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)

# What do I need to make the bot work ?

* You will need [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for the play, stop and skip commands, as ytdl-core package needs ffmpeg or it will not work.
* Make a folder and git clone this repository: [RaptorSA.git](https://github.com/Cramenorn/RaptorSA.git).
* Before typing `npm install`, you should check the **package.json** file. The installation process is different if you choose one of the two packages:
    * If you are going to use the bot in a production environment you should use the `@discordjs/opus`, in this case you do not need to edit the package.json file. Before typing `npm install`, this package requires the C++ tools, on Windows 10 you simply need to download Visual Studio and install the [Windows desktop development with C++ tool](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/windows-desktop-development-with-c-in-visual-studio/#installation). 
    * For testing purposes you should use the following package `"opusscript": "^0.0.7"` (change **@discordjs/opus** package with **opusscript**, they can't work together, you need to use one of them), you do not need to do anything in particular. You can directly install the packages as specified in the next step below.
* Then type `npm install` to get the needed packages for the bot.
* Check if **ytdl-core** is updated with the following command `npm outdated`, if the current version is not updated to the latest, type `npm update ytdl-core` and update the package.json file.
* Edit json files in jsonFiles folder, you need a discord bot **Token** and various **Api Keys** to get the bot work.
* Launch the `index.js` file.
